        "* A significant part of developing machine learning models involves experimentation. Tracking and managing these experiments can become challenging as the number of experiments grows. To address this, we use tools like Weights and Biases (wandb), which help in logging and visualizing metrics, saving model checkpoints, and comparing different runs effectively.\n",
        "* The training loop has been updated to log both training and validation metrics (such as loss) to wandb. This allows you to monitor the model's performance in real-time and keep track of the training process. Additionally, the model's parameters are saved at each epoch, but only the best-performing model (based on validation loss) is preserved. This ensures that you can always retrieve the best model from your experiments."
